Everest _(formerly RESTaurant)_ is an upcoming REST API testing client written in JavaFX.

![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23148259/45769743-23e5a380-bc5e-11e8-9e45-5ea50342c19f.PNG)

# Why Everest?
- Everest is written in Java. Thus, it is significantly **lighter on resources and more responsive** than its Electron-based alternatives like _Postman_. It aims to provide the same level of functionality in a lighter, native but equally slick package.
- Aesthetic is very important. With a **gorgeous, flat design**, Everest is a pleasure to look at and to work with. It is also entirely theme-_able_.

  > I want you to want to use it!

- Being a Java application, Everest is inherently **cross-platform**. It will run anywhere there's a JVM.
- Everest will offer cloud synchronization of your projects powered by [Summit](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Summit). It will be available as a cloud service early next year or you may also choose to self-host it.

#### API Authentication
- Basic Auth
- Digest Auth

#### Custom Themes
Everest is entirely theme-_able_ via CSS. For more details, refer [this guide](THEMES.md).

#### Efficient multi-tabbing
Everest utilizes a technique called _pseudo tab-switching_ to maintain a low memory footprint even when heavy multi-tabbing. I have written a highly technical piece about this on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/rohit).

_**Bonus**: The '+' button for adding new tabs is finally live!_

#### History
Everest maintains the history of all the requests made by you. You can search with any of the request's components: the target, the headers, the method, the body or even the files added to the request. Everest will **intelligently rank** the results based on their relevance.

# Upcoming features ‚è≥
#### OAuth Support
Everest will fully support both of the OAuth standards. Work on **OAuth 2.0 is in progress** right now and will be available with Alpha 1.4. OAuth 1.0 will follow next. 

#### Everest Project
- This will be Everest's equivalent of Postman's Collection or Insomnia's Workspace.
- Will house **named-requests**.
- Will support **environment variables**. Every request can have its own.
- Can be exported/imported.

#### Summit
![summitheader](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23148259/45769968-cbfb6c80-bc5e-11e8-95c7-7d418dee54d5.png)
- [Summit](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Summit) is the synchronization server for Everest.
- It will allow for synchronization of your Everest Projects across multiple devices and other members of your team.
- It will use a Node.js-_powered_ RESTful API and Socket.IO.
- It will be available early next year as a service. You may also choose to self-host Summit.

#### Extension API
This will allow developers to create extensions for Everest which can for example, sync to Google Drive, or visualize the response bodies in a certain fashion or summon Batman.

#### Mock Server
This local server can be used to quickly create a mock REST-_ful_ service with the endpoints of your choice, producing the output of your choice.

# Releases üöÄ
Everest is under active development and you can get the latest alpha build from [Releases](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Everest/releases). Make sure you read the release notes to understand what works and what doesn't, how to report issues and how to run the binary.

# Building from source üî®
Everest uses Maven, so building from the source code is very simple. You need to have a minimum of JDK 8 (9 should also work) installed, along with Maven and Git. If you're using OpenJDK, you will need to install OpenJFX separately. Once you have everything set up, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RohitAwate/Everest.git`
2. Enter the repository: `cd Everest`
3. Build a binary: `./mvnw package`
4. Run the binary: `./mvnw exec:java`

**For JDK  10 and above:** JavaFX has been decoupled from the JDK and will need to be installed separately.
