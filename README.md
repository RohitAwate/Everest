# Why Everest?
- Unlike other REST clients like Postman and Insomnia, Everest is written in Java. Thus, it is significantly
  **lighter on resources and more responsive** than the Electron-based options. The goal with Everest is to provide pretty much the same
  level of functionality as the other options, but in a lighter, native but equally slick package. It is a big and slightly arrogant bet, 
  but then I don't think anyone other than me would use this! So heck, at least I'll learnt a lot. _Not bad for a Comp Sci student, eh?_
- In all of my projects, design is of paramount importance. And Everest is no exception.
  With a **gorgeous, flat design and a neutral color scheme**, Everest is a pleasure to look at and to work with.
  _I want you to want to use it!_
- Being a Java application, Everest is inherently **cross-platform**. It will run anywhere there's a JVM.
- Everest is powered by **Jersey**, the robust and powerful Java library to build and consume RESTful web services.

_Making a GET request with Everest._


# Features currently live
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH requests.
- Adding request headers, query parameters and the request body (raw, octet-stream, URL-encoded or form-data)
- Response details (HTTP status code, response type, time, size)
- **Custom themes!** I encourage you to develop new themes by taking reference of [Adreana](https://github.com/RohitAwate/RESTaurant/blob/master/src/main/resources/css/Adreana.css). I plan on documenting it better in the future. Changing themes needs a manual edit to `Everest/config/settings.json`. This will be properly integrated into a Settings menu soon. üåà
- **Multi-tab layout**. I'm battling with JavaFX to allow me to add a simple '+' button for adding a new tab. So far, not successful. However, you can use the Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut.
- **History tab!** All the requests you ever made are now shown to the left of the app. üïí
- **Searching through your request history**. Everest searches not just on the basis of the request target but all other parameters that form the request including headers, the request body, query parameters and even file names. It will intelligently rank the results on the basis of their relevance. üîé
- Everest now maintains its state between sessions so you don't lose your work. üß†
- **Visualizer** You can now view JSON responses just as you would your file tree. Support for XML coming up next!

_Everest's search feature in action._

# Upcoming features
- **Syntax highlighting**: I had tried using [RichTextFX](https://github.com/FXMisc/RichTextFX) for my text editor, 
  [Ballad](https://github.com/RohitAwate/Ballad), and failed. And I really don't wish to embed an
  online editor like Ace into Everest. So, for the time being, I'm gonna use JavaFX's inbuilt TextArea which doesn't offer syntax highlighting.
- **API Authentication**: This is of course a primary feature of any REST client, but currently, not something I've done or used before.
  So I will need some time to learn this stuff.
- **Text prediction** for the address bar based on your history.
- _Postman_ has this really cool feature wherein it can create a **mock server**. I'll do that once the core features are implemented and if it doesn't severely impact performance.
